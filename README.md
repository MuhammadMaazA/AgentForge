## üéØ The Problem We Solve

Building AI applications involves repetitive boilerplate: setting up API clients, structuring frontend-backend communication, and writing basic UI code. This slows down innovation and makes it hard to quickly prototype new ideas.

**AgentForge changes that.** We abstract the tedious setup into a simple, declarative form. You focus on *what* your AI agent should do, and we handle the *how*, generating a ready-to-use Streamlit application in seconds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

AgentForge is a full-stack monorepo built with modern, scalable technologies.

| Area      | Technology                                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**  | [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), [**React**](https://react.dev/), [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| **Backend**   | [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)                         |
| **Styling**   | [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/)                                                                 |
| **AI Core**   | [**OpenAI API**](https://platform.openai.com/) (GPT-4o)                                                    |

This repository currently provides a minimal FastAPI backend and a basic Next.js
frontend to kickstart development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run AgentForge locally? Follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9 or later)
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MuhammadMaazA/AgentForge.git
    cd AgentForge
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create an environment file from the example
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open `backend/.env` with a text editor and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd ../frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You need to run the frontend and backend in two separate terminal windows.

-   **Terminal 1: Run the Backend**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the 'backend' directory and your venv is active
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    Your backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

-   **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the 'frontend' directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser!

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

This project is the foundation for a much larger vision. Here are the next steps:

-   [ ] **Multi-File Generation:** Upgrade the AI prompt to generate a full file structure (e.g., `app.py`, `utils.py`, `requirements.txt`) as a JSON object.
-   [ ] **Integrated IDE:** Replace the simple code display with a Monaco Editor instance and a file tree to create a true IDE experience.
-   [ ] **One-Click Run:** Use Docker to create a secure sandbox environment where users can execute the generated code directly from the UI.
-   [ ] **Vector DB Integration:** Add options for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to allow agents to work with user-provided documents.
-   [ ] **User Accounts & Deployment:** Add user authentication to save projects and one-click deployment options to services like Vercel and Render.
